<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>The Active 20-30 Club of US &amp; Canada provides young adults the opportunity for personal growth, friendship and leadership development, while improving the lives of children in the Pacific Northwest. The Portland Chapter (#122) is a group for men and women between the ages of 20 and 39 and is filled with community-minded members who are interested in philanthropy, friendship and fun!</p>
<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>We have monthly meetings and socials where we discuss upcoming events, fundraising and club growth. Additionally, we host and participate in hands-on service opportunities. We are very focused on rolling up our sleeves and serving at-risk youth in the Portland metro area. We work with a number of organizations throughout the Pacific Northwest that serve the most vulnerable children in our community.</p>
<h2>How We Do It</h2>
<p>We raise money through fundraising events in order to give back to our local community. Because we are a dues-based organization, 100% of the money we raise goes directly back to the organizations we work with and the youth we serve.</p>
